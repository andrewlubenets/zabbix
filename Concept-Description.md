# Zabbix SaaS on AWS: The solution involves setting up Zabbix, an open-source monitoring tool, on the AWS cloud. It uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management.

# Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform: The Terraform scripts handle the deployment of AWS infrastructure components like EC2 instances, RDS, VPC, subnets, and security groups.
# Configuration Management with Ansible: Ansible is used to automate the installation and configuration of Zabbix on the provisioned infrastructure.
# AWS CodePipeline Integration: The integration of AWS CodePipeline automates the deployment process,

## Repository Structure

# Terraform Playbooks: The Terraform code defines the required AWS infrastructure, ensuring modularity and reusability.
# Ansible Playbooks: Ansible code for setting up and configuring Zabbix, including roles for the Zabbix server and agents.
# CI/CD with CodePipeline: Terraform setup for AWS CodePipeline, facilitating automated deployment.

## Additional Requirements

# Dynamic Parameterization: Utilizing Terraform variables for customization (instance types, regions, etc.) and Ansible variables for software configuration.
# Scalability and High Availability: The AWS infrastructure design should incorporate scalability (like auto-scaling groups) and high availability (multi-AZ deployment, RDS configuration).
# Security Considerations: Security groups in AWS for EC2 and RDS instances and secure configurations in Ansible playbooks need to be well-defined to align with best practices. Implement encrypted communications between components. Least privilege for IAM roles and policies. 
# Cost Optimization: Strategies for cost optimization, such as selecting appropriate instance types or using reserved instances, should be considered.
